#💡 Concept
User Story:

As a young adult looking for a more meaningful social media experience, I want a platform where I can share short thoughts and connect with people intentionally—free from algorithm-driven feeds and repost culture.

Motivation:
Modern social media has become overwhelming, repetitive, and driven by trends. CRNTLY offers a stripped-down, authentic platform where people connect with real posts, not popularity metrics.
